/**
 * There are several compositing operations. We show some of them in the next code example.
 * The AlphaComposite class implements basic alpha compositing rules for combining source
 * and destination colours to achieve blending and transparency effects with graphics and images.
 * <p>
 * Say we want to draw two objects on a panel. The first object drawn is called a destination,
 * the second one a source.
 * The AlphaComposite class determines how these two objects are going to be blended together.
 * If we have a AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER rule, the pixels of the source object will be drawn
 * where the two objects overlap.
