/**
 * In this part of the Java 2D programming tutorial, we first talk about hit testing. We show how to determine if we
 * have clicked inside a shape on a panel. In the second example, we create two shapes that we can move with a mouse on
 * the panel and resize them with a mouse wheel. In the last example, we will be resizing a rectangle with two
 * controlling points.
